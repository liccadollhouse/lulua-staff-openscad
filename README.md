OpenSCAD code for Lulua's staff.

Version history:

v.1.0 - Initial version for San Japan's cosplay contest (2019, before the pandemic!)

The way I do my OpenSCAD code is the following:  I create a "master" file with all the modules of the individual parts of the staff.  Then, I create individual OpenSCADs files that includes the master file, and only calls the individual module that is to be printed.  As this staff is going to be redesigned, I will be adding the individual files as I redesign each part and verify that I can actually print it.  Currently, the only part I have redesigned is the ferule on the bottom of the staff.

Notably, this staff has parts that are designed for resin printers; I will indicate which parts I used a resin printer.

I am, of course, open to suggestions and improvements; when I designed this initially, I did the entire design in less than two hours of work, and it was designed so I could print this as quickly as possible (I had maybe 2 days to print, assemble, and paint the staff when I did this).  I will definitely be making improvements to this model as time permits.  You may contact me through GitHub.
